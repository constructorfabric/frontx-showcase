## 1. Feature Context

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-template-site-meta-feature-generate-and-check`

### 1.1 Overview

Runs the pipeline as the project's two commands. `generate`, after the project's build, applies every rule and writes every output and twin into the build output. `check`, in the project's checks, applies the same rules and, when generated outputs exist, generates them again on the recorded origin and names each that differs. Both share one loading, rule and rendering path, bundle head-sync with esbuild, check the routing version, check the raster record and run from one command line.

### 1.2 Purpose

Published metadata must never go stale silently. Generation refuses to write anything while a rule fails or a linked asset is missing, and the check fails on every output that no longer equals what the sources produce, so a change is made in a source and generated again rather than edited in the output.

**Requirements**: `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-linked-assets`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-metadata-rules`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-output-drift`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-routing-version`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-raster-record`, `cpt-template-site-meta-nfr-deterministic-outputs` (shared with the outputs feature: this feature keeps the bundled runtime deterministic and compares bytes; that feature keeps the rendered outputs pure)

**Principles**: `cpt-template-site-meta-principle-regenerate-never-edit`

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-project-build` | Runs generation after the production build and the check in continuous integration |
| `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-project-developer` | Runs the check and the command line, and reads the failures that name the screen, route or output at fault |

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

**Use cases**: `cpt-template-site-meta-usecase-generate`, `cpt-template-site-meta-usecase-check`

### Generate After the Build

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-generate`

**Actor**: `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-project-build`

**Success Scenarios**:
- The build runs generation with an origin, every rule holds and every linked asset exists: every output and twin is written into the build output and listed.

**Error Scenarios**:
- No origin: generation stops with the message naming `site.config.json.origin`.
- A rule fails: generation stops listing every failure, and nothing is written.
- The build output has no built document: generation stops asking for the build first.
- A linked asset is missing from the build output: generation stops naming each missing file.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - Show a path in a message relative to the project - `inst-shown-path`
2. [x] - `p1` - The build runs generation; load the site on the origin resolved from the preview override or the configuration - `inst-load-on-origin`
3. [x] - `p1` - Apply the configuration rule, the metadata rules, the routing version check and the raster record check; **IF** any fails, stop listing every failure - `inst-if-rules-fail`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** the build output has no `index.html`, stop asking for the build first - `inst-if-no-build`
5. [x] - `p1` - Read the built document; **IF** a linked asset is missing, stop naming each one - `inst-if-missing-assets`
6. [x] - `p1` - Render every output and twin - `inst-render`
7. [x] - `p1` - **FOR EACH** output, create its folder and write it into the build output - `inst-write-outputs`
8. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the written files relative to the project - `inst-return-written`

### Check in the Project's Checks

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-check`

**Actor**: `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- Without generated outputs: the rules hold and the result says no outputs were compared.
- With generated outputs: the rules hold and every output equals what the sources generate on the recorded origin.

**Error Scenarios**:
- A rule fails: each failure is reported.
- A linked asset is missing from the build output: each missing file is named.
- An output differs from what the sources generate or is missing: each is named with the command that generates it again.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p1` - The developer or continuous integration runs the check; read the origin recorded in the build output's page map manifest, when there is one - `inst-read-recorded-origin`
2. [x] - `p1` - Load the site on the recorded origin, or on a placeholder origin that enters no rule - `inst-load-site`
3. [x] - `p1` - Apply the configuration rule, the metadata rules, the routing version check and the raster record check - `inst-apply-rules`
4. [x] - `p1` - **IF** generated outputs exist - `inst-if-outputs-exist`
   1. [x] - `p1` - Read the built document and report every missing linked asset - `inst-check-assets`
   2. [x] - `p1` - Render every output again; **FOR EACH** output, **IF** its file is missing or differs, report it with the command to generate again - `inst-compare-outputs`
5. [x] - `p1` - **RETURN** the failures and whether outputs were compared - `inst-return-result`

### Run the Command Line

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-command-line`

**Actor**: `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-project-developer`

**Success Scenarios**:
- `generate` prints the written files relative to the working directory and exits 0.
- `check` prints that the rules hold and whether the outputs are in sync or none were compared, and exits 0.

**Error Scenarios**:
- A usage error prints the usage and exits 2.
- A failed check prints each failure and exits 1.
- A thrown failure prints its message and exits 1.

**Steps**:
1. [x] - `p2` - Take the project the package sits in, four levels above its source folder, as the default project - `inst-default-project`
2. [x] - `p2` - The developer runs the command; parse the arguments; **IF** they are invalid, print the message and **RETURN** exit code 2 - `inst-if-usage-error`
3. [x] - `p2` - **IF** the command is `generate`, run generation, print the written files relative to the working directory and **RETURN** exit code 0 - `inst-if-generate`
4. [x] - `p2` - Run the check; **IF** it reports failures, print each and **RETURN** exit code 1 - `inst-if-check-fails`
5. [x] - `p2` - Print that the rules hold and that the outputs are in sync, or that there were none to compare; **RETURN** exit code 0 - `inst-report-check`
6. [x] - `p2` - Set the process exit code from the result; **IF** the run throws, print its message and set exit code 1 - `inst-exit-code`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### No Feature-Owned State Machine

Not applicable because each command is one run from sources to files or messages; the only persisted result is the build output, which the next generation replaces and the check compares, with no lifecycle of its own.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Generation

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-generate-and-check-generate`

The system **MUST** generate only after every rule holds, the built document exists and every linked asset is in the build output, bundle head-sync deterministically, link the documented packages' published `llms.txt` without fetching it, write every output and twin into the build output only and return the written files.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-generate`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-load-site`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-render-outputs`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-linked-assets`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-generator`
- Entities: `SitePaths`, `SiteMetaMap`

### Check and Drift

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-generate-and-check-check`

The system **MUST** apply the configuration and metadata rules in the check as in generation and, when generated outputs exist, generate them again on the recorded origin and name each output that differs or is missing; without outputs it **MUST** say that none were compared.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-check`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-rules`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-generator`
- Entities: `SiteConfig`, `ScreenExtension`

### One Routing Version

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-generate-and-check-routing-version`

The system **MUST** fail generation and the check when the routing copy esbuild resolves for head-sync is another version than the one the project runs.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-routing-version`

**Constraints**: `cpt-template-site-meta-constraint-routing-version`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-generator`

### Raster Record

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-generate-and-check-rasters`

The system **MUST** parse the raster record strictly, resolve its paths against the record's folder, and report a missing file, a source changed since its raster was drawn, a raster that is not the recorded one and a copy that differs from its source; without a record it **MUST** check nothing.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-rasters`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-raster-check`
- Entities: `RastersRecord`

### Command Line

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-generate-and-check-command-line`

The system **MUST** run `generate` or `check` with the `--project`, `--config` and `--rasters` options resolved against the working directory, the project defaulting to the one the package sits in and the configuration to `site.config.json` in the project, print failures and written files relative to the working directory, and exit 0 on success, 1 on failure and 2 on a usage error.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-flow-generate-and-check-command-line`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-generate-and-check-parse-args`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-command-line`
- Entities: `SitePaths`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The check reports the rules alone when the build output has no generated outputs.
- [x] The check holds right after generation and names every output that drifts from the sources.
- [x] Generation writes a twin per outline page from its strings and data, lists it in `llms.txt` and the check holds it to its sources.
- [x] Generation is refused when the build lacks an icon the head links, or an icon the built page links, the main favicon among them.
- [x] The check fails when a share image is configured without its alternative text.
- [x] A missing metadata block, a missing title, a description outside 50 to 160 characters, two pages with one title, two route keys naming one address and a route key that is not a path inside the screen are each refused.
- [x] The routing version check holds when the tool bundles the project's copy, when both copies are one version or when the project has no install, and fails when the tool resolves its own copy of another version.
- [x] The raster check does nothing without a record, holds while every raster and copy matches, and names an edited source with its stale copy, a replaced raster and a missing recorded file.
- [x] The command line takes the command, the project the package sits in and the configuration inside it by default, resolves the options against the working directory, and refuses an unknown command, an unknown option and an option without its value.

**Test scenarios** (all in `template-site-meta/src-app/verify_packages/site-meta/src/`, the project fixture in `test-support/project.ts`):
- `check.test.ts`: the `check` cases ("reports the rules alone when site/dist has no generated outputs"; "holds right after generation, and names every output that drifts from the sources"; "writes a plain-text twin per outline page from its strings and data, lists it in llms.txt and holds it to its sources"; "refuses to generate when the build lacks an icon the head links"; "refuses to generate when the built page links an icon the build lacks, the main favicon among them"; "fails the check when a share image is configured without its alternative text"); the `checkConfig`, `linkedIcons`, `checkRoutingVersion`, `checkRasters` cases and "the duplicate canonical rule".
- `generate.test.ts`: "seo rules hold for well-formed metadata"; "require a seo block, a title and a 50 to 160 character description"; "refuse two pages with one title, and a route key that is not a path inside the screen".
- `args.test.ts`: the three `parseArgs` cases.
