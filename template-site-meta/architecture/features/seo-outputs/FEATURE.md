## 1. Feature Context

- [x] `p1` - `cpt-template-site-meta-feature-seo-outputs`

### 1.1 Overview

The output renderers: pure functions that turn the page map into the head block of the built document, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `seo-manifest.json` and `site.webmanifest`, with no file access of their own. The generator writes what they return and the check compares it.

### 1.2 Purpose

These outputs are everything a crawler, a link preview or a browser installing the site reads from a build. Keeping each one a pure function of the page map makes every output deterministic, testable by snapshot and comparable byte for byte by the check, and keeps the static head and the runtime head on one tag list.

**Requirements**: `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-site-head`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-discovery-files`, `cpt-template-site-meta-fr-web-manifest`, `cpt-template-site-meta-nfr-deterministic-outputs` (shared with generate-and-check: this feature keeps every rendered output a pure function of the page map; that feature keeps the bundled runtime deterministic), `cpt-template-site-meta-nfr-head-before-boot` (shared with head-sync: this feature places the inline map and script ahead of the module scripts; that feature runs with no request of its own)

**Principles**: none of its own beyond those of the page map it depends on.

### 1.3 Actors

| Actor | Role in Feature |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-crawler` | Reads the robots file, the sitemap, the site-level head, `llms.txt` and the page map manifest |
| `cpt-template-site-meta-actor-visitor` | Installs the site from the browser through the web manifest and sees the icons the head links |

### 1.4 References

- **PRD**: [PRD.md](../../PRD.md)
- **Design**: [DESIGN.md](../../DESIGN.md), component `cpt-template-site-meta-component-output-renderers`, sequence `cpt-template-site-meta-seq-crawl`
- **Decomposition**: [DECOMPOSITION.md](../../DECOMPOSITION.md)
- **Dependencies**: `cpt-template-site-meta-feature-page-map` (the map and its static pages), `cpt-template-site-meta-feature-head-sync` (the head tag list and the map node id), `cpt-template-site-meta-feature-plain-text-twins` (the twins `llms.txt` lists)
- **Code**: `template-site-meta/src-app/verify_packages/site-meta/src/outputs.ts`

## 2. Actor Flows (CDSL)

**Use cases**: `cpt-template-site-meta-usecase-crawl` is served by the files this feature renders; no code of the template runs while a crawler reads them.

### No Actor Flow of Its Own

The crawl is a series of reads of static files from the host; the renderers run inside the generate and check flows of generate-and-check, which call the processes below.

## 3. Processes / Business Logic (CDSL)

2. [x] - `p2` - **RETURN** the manifest as indented JSON - `inst-return-web-manifest`

## 4. States (CDSL)

### No Feature-Owned State Machine

Not applicable because every renderer is a pure function of its inputs; generating again replaces the head block instead of adding to it, so the document has no state beyond its content.

## 5. Definitions of Done

### Discovery Files

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-seo-outputs-discovery-files`

The system **MUST** render the sitemap of every indexable static page in menu order, a robots file that allows crawling and names the sitemap, `llms.txt` with a section per screen, grouped pages, the twins and the documented packages, and the page map manifest keyed by canonical address with the pattern pages apart, each as a pure function of its inputs.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-sitemap-robots`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-llms`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-seo-manifest`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-output-renderers`
- Entities: `SiteMetaMap`, `PageMeta`, `Twin`

### Site Head in the Built Document

- [x] `p1` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-seo-outputs-site-head`

The system **MUST** write the site-level head into the built document once, between its delimiters right after the title, with the language, the title, the shared head tags of the site-level page, the theme colour, the icon and manifest links relative to the document, the page map inlined as inert JSON and the head-sync runtime as a classic script that runs before the module scripts, with no inlined text able to close its script element.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-index-html`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-icon-set`

**Constraints**: `cpt-template-site-meta-constraint-no-shell-head-port`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-output-renderers`
- Entities: `SiteMetaMap`, `PageMeta`

### Web Manifest

- [x] `p2` - **ID**: `cpt-template-site-meta-dod-seo-outputs-web-manifest`

The system **MUST** render a web manifest with the site's name, short name, description and language, the home page as start address relative to the manifest, the configured colours and the icon set.

**Implements**:
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-web-manifest`
- `cpt-template-site-meta-algo-seo-outputs-icon-set`

**Touches**:
- Component: `cpt-template-site-meta-component-output-renderers`
- Entities: `SiteMetaMap`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `sitemap.xml` lists every indexable page and no pattern route.
- [x] `llms.txt` has a section per screen in menu order, routes grouped by their first segment, and the package links.
- [x] `robots.txt` points at the sitemap on the origin.
- [x] `seo-manifest.json` keys pages by canonical address and lists pattern routes apart.
- [x] `index.html` gets the site-level head, the page map and the script once, however often it is generated.
- [x] Inlined text never closes its script element, and the script stays valid.
- [x] A share image path resolves on the origin and the head carries its alternative text.
- [x] The icons and the web manifest are linked relative to the document, so the head works at any mount point.
- [x] The web manifest starts at the home page with the site colours and icons.

**Test scenarios** (all in `template-site-meta/src-app/verify_packages/site-meta/src/`):
- `outputs.test.ts` with its snapshot `__snapshots__/outputs.test.ts.snap`: "sitemap.xml lists every indexable page, no pattern route"; "llms.txt has a section per screen in menu order, routes grouped by their first segment, and the package links"; "robots.txt points at the sitemap on the origin"; "seo-manifest.json keys pages by canonical URL and lists pattern routes apart"; "index.html gets the site-level head, the page map and the script once, however often it is generated"; "index.html never lets inlined text close its script element, and keeps the script valid"; "resolves a share image path on the origin and gives it its alternative text in the head"; "links the icons and the web manifest relative to the document, so the head works at any mount point"; "writes a web manifest that starts at the home page with the site colors and icons".
- `bundle.test.ts`: the generated document with the real bundle, run in jsdom, applies the page of its address and follows a history step.
